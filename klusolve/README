This is a repackaging of the original KLUSolve to use system SuiteSparse libraries using CMake.
See the original at https://sourceforge.net/p/klusolve/code/HEAD/tree/ and, as explicit in COPYING, this work uses the same license, LGPL 2.1 or later.

The modifications target only the building system. In the near future, we will try to use the upstream KLUSolve, providing only the CMake instructions.
